# Exp 05- STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Student Enrollment Management System.

# SRS (Procedure):

## Step 1: Problem Identification

Manual student admission and record handling are time-consuming and prone to errors. The system aims to automate student registration, course enrollment, and record management efficiently.

## Step 2: Requirement Analysis

Users: Admin, Staff, and Student.      
Main Functions: Student registration, course enrollment, fee payment, record updating, and report generation.    
Non-Functional Needs: Security, reliability, and an easy-to-use interface.

## Step 3: System Design

Draw UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.    
Design database tables for Students, Courses, Enrollment, and Fees.
